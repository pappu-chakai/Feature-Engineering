Its primary goal is to minimize the loss function, which essentially measures how well the model is performing. Optimizers achieve this by iteratively updating the model's parameters based on the gradients of the loss function with respect to those parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Different Types of Optimizers:\n",
        "\n",
        "     1. Gradient Descent:\n",

Gradient descent updates model parameters similarly, aiming to reach the bottom of the \"valley\" where the loss is minimized.\n",

        "      2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):#    - Concept: Instead of\n",
        "         using the entire dataset to calculate the gradient, SGD uses only a small random subset (a mini-batch) of the data. This makes it computationally more efficient, especially for large datasets.\n",

        "        - Concept: Momentum helps accelerate SGD in the relevant\n",

        "        - Example: Imagine pushing a heavy box down a hill. Momentum\n",
        "          helps the box gain speed and overcome obstacles more effectively. The momentum term in the optimizer adds a push in the direction of the previous update, making the optimization process smoother and potentially faster.\n",

        "       - Concept: Adapts the learning rate for each parameter\n",

        "       - Example: Think of a student who excels in some subjects\n",

Adagrad would adjust the learning rate for each subject accordingly, allowing for faster progress in areas where the student is struggling while slowing down the learning rate in areas where they are already doing well.\n",
        "\n",
        "     5. RMSprop:\n",
        "       - Concept: Similar to Adagrad but with a decaying average of\n",
